    <h1 class="pad">About Us</h1>
    <p class="pad">We are a small start-up company called Reality For All that is based in Salt Lake City, and more specifically, Neumont University. Originally, we had partnered up with Smith's to create an enhanced scanner to decrease scanning times with products. While this idea never came to fruition, it was from this collaboration that our book reader was conceived.</p>

    <p class="pad">Our sales have been steadily growing, and we are seeking to expand to other continents. With increasing sales comes a greater worldwide reputation, which eventually allows us to develop larger projects.</p>
