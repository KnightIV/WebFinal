    <h1 class="pad">About Us</h1>

    <p class="pad">We are a small start-up company looking to advertise our product. Based in Salt Lake City, we had initially partnered up with Smith's to create a newly enhanced scanner to decrease scanning times with products. While this idea never came to fruition, it was from this collaboration that our book reader was conceived.</p>

    <p class="pad">Our sales have been steadily growing, and we are seeking to expand to other continents. With increasing sales comes a greater worldwide reputation, which eventually allows us to develop larger projects.</p>
